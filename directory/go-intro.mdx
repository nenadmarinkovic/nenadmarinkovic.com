## Variables and Data Types

In Go, variables are declared using the var keyword. Go supports several data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  var a int = 10
  var b float64 = 3.14
  var c string = "hello"
  var d bool = true

  fmt.Println(a, b, c, d)
}
```

Output:

```go
10 3.14 hello true
```

## Control Structures

Go supports control structures such as if-else statements, for loops, and switch statements. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  x := 10

  if x < 5 {
    fmt.Println("x is less than 5")
  } else if x > 5 {
    fmt.Println("x is greater than 5")
  } else {
    fmt.Println("x is equal to 5")
  }

  for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
  }

  switch x {
    case 1:
      fmt.Println("x is 1")
    case 5:
      fmt.Println("x is 5")
    default:
      fmt.Println("x is not 1 or 5")
  }
}
```

Output:

```go
x is greater than 5
0
1
2
3
4
x is not 1 or 5
```

## Functions

In Go, functions are declared using the func keyword. Go supports multiple return values and function parameters. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a, b int) int {
  return a + b
}

func swap(a, b string) (string, string) {
  return b, a
}

func main() {
  fmt.Println(add(5, 10))

  x, y := "hello", "world"
  x, y = swap(x, y)
  fmt.Println(x, y)
}
```

Output:

```go
15
world hello
```

## Structs

Go supports structs, which are collections of fields that can be of any type. Structs are similar to classes in other object-oriented programming languages. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
  name string
  age int
}

func main() {
  p := Person{name: "John", age: 30}
  fmt.Println(p.name, p.age)
}
```

Output:

```go
John 30
```

## Pointers

Go supports pointers, which are variables that hold the memory address of another variable. Go also supports the & and * operators for working with pointers. Here is an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  x := 10
  y := &x
  fmt.Println(*y)

  *y = 20
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```

Output:

```go
10
20
```
