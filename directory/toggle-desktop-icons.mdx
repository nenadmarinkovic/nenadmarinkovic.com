If you seek a quick way to toggle desktop icon visibility, creating aliases in your shell configuration file (.zshrc for Zsh or .bashrc and .bash_profile for Bash) offers a streamlined solution. Below, If'll explain the process of making aliases for the showdesk and hidedesk commands.

Depending on your shell, locate and open the respective configuration file. For Zsh, it's typically ~/.zshrc, and for Bash, it can be either ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

To create aliases for showdesk and hidedesk, add this in your shell configuration file:

```bash
alias showdesk='defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true && killall Finder'
alias hidedesk='defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false && killall Finder'
```

Save the changes to the respective configuration file and restart your terminal or run source ~/.zshrc (for Zsh) or source ~/.bashrc / source ~/.bash_profile (for Bash) to apply the changes immediately.

With the aliases in place, using them is straightforward:

```bash
showdesk
```

```bash
hidedesk
```

To view a list of defined aliases:

```bash
alias
```

These aliases serve as shortcuts, enhancing your command-line experience and providing a quick solution to toggle desktop icons based on your preferences.
