## Mind Children - Hans Moravec

- [x] Finished.

Hans Moravec's book "Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence" is a visionary exploration of the future of artificial intelligence and robotics. In the book, Moravec argues that intelligent machines will eventually surpass human intelligence, leading to a transformation of humanity as we know it.

Moravec begins by discussing the evolution of computing power, and how it has led to the development of artificial intelligence. He then delves into the idea of machine consciousness, arguing that it is not only possible but inevitable. He predicts that machines will be able to perform all cognitive tasks, including creativity and emotion, and that they will eventually become the dominant form of intelligence on the planet.

The book also explores the social and ethical implications of advanced AI, including the potential for machines to outstrip human abilities and the question of whether machines can have consciousness and rights. Moravec argues that we must be prepared for these changes and work to ensure that the benefits of advanced AI are shared by all.

Overall, "Mind Children" is a thought-provoking look at the potential of artificial intelligence and the future of humanity. Moravec's predictions may be controversial, but they offer a fascinating glimpse into the possibilities of a world in which machines are as intelligent as humans.
