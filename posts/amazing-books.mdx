### This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:

```javascript
        next.config.js focus=1:2,7
        const { remarkCodeHike } = require("@code-hike/mdx");
        const theme = require("shiki/themes/monokai.json");

        const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
        extension: /\.mdx?$/,
        options: {
            remarkPlugins: [[remarkCodeHike, { theme }]],
            rehypePlugins: [],
        },
        });

        module.exports = withMDX({
        pageExtensions: ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
        });
```

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
